FizzBuzz
========
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
- But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number.
- And for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.Sample output
-------------
```
12Fizz4BuzzFizz78FizzBuzz11Fizz1314FizzBuzz1617Fizz19Buzz
...
...
... etc up to 100
```

Ideas for after the Dojo
------------------------- When you’ve got it all working for “Fizz” and “Buzz”, add “Whizz” for multiples of seven- Then add “Fizz” also for all numbers containing a 3 (eg 23, 53).
